## Project Description

This Laravel-based web application provides users with the ability to create profiles, log in, and interact with a dashboard for posting text content along with images. The dashboard offers features for editing, deleting, and activating/inactivating posts. Users can also filter data based on dates from their dashboard. The home route displays all users' posts from the present date, with filtering options available for both date and user. The system is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
